    "# Hacking the Humanities Week 3: Analysing Corpora\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week we learned how to analyse a text. This week, we are going to analyse a corpus. A corpus is simply a collection of texts (or, if you have a taste for Latin, a 'body' of texts). You are going to learn how to structure a program so that you can perform a task on many texts at once, and also learn how to organise your data in Python so you can easily call up particular texts from a large corpus for closer inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also going to go a bit deeper into the problem of pre-processing. You have seen how punctuation, capital letters and special characters (e.g. `é`, `ç` or `ł`) can make it complicated to get from the tokens of a text to the types they represent. This week you will learn how to use **regular expressions**, powerful tools for flexibly interacting with text. Other popular languages like `R` and `JavaScript` use regular expressions in much the same way Python does, so you can easily take what you learn here into other projects."

    "In this section, you will learn how to find and delete this 'boilerplate' from your documents using regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crucial concept you need to understand is the idea of a **pattern**. A regular expression is a special type of object in Python, which is defined by a particular pattern. This pattern is a kind of template or detector that the regular expression uses to scan through a string, looking for matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we use the following pattern:\n",
    "```\n",
    "'Kerryn.{0,10}Phelps'\n",
    "```\n",
    "This pattern has four main parts:\n",
    "* `\"Kerryn\"`: looks for the exact characters `K`, `e`, `r`, `r`, `y`, `n` in exactly that order.\n",
    "* `\".\"`: this is a 'wildcard'. It looks for *any* character at all of *any* kind (with one exception, as I explain below).\n",
    "* `\"{0,10}\"`: this little nugget means 'look for 0-10 of whatever came just before this'.\n",
    "* `\"Phelps\"`: looks for the exact characters `P`, `h`, `e`, `l`, `p`, `s` in exactly that order.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's put this back together. This pattern is quite a simple one, really. It tells the computer to \"Look for K, e, r, r, y and n in exactly that order, then look for 0-10 characters of any kind, followed by the characters P, h, e, l, p, s in exactly that order.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expression objects have many useful methods. One is `.sub()`, which looks for matches to the pattern, and replaces every match it finds with whatever you tell it to.\n",

In a regular expression, \"`\\d`\" normally means \"any digit\", but `\"\\\\d\"` would mean \"a backslash followed by a lower-case `d`\"\n",
    "* Square brackets \"`[]`\" are used to define a \"character class\". So \"`[rs]`\" means \"r or s\", and \"`[A-Z]`\" means \"A,B,C,D,E,F ... W,X,Y or Z\".\n",
    "* The `.sub()` method requires two parameters, and probably in the opposite order to what you expect. If you look back at the example, you'll see that it expects `.sub(replacement, string)`, where `replacement` is what you want the regular expression to substitute when it finds a match, and `string` is the string where you want it to search for matches."
