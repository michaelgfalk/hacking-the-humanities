    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the explainer videos, there are two different kinds of equals sign in Python (as in many other programming languages). A single equals sign, `=`, is the *assignment operator*. It assigns a value to a variable. The double equals sign, `==`, is the *equality operator*. It checks if one variable or literal is equal to another. There are a range of similar operators in Python, such as `!=`, which is the *negation operator*, or `>=`, which is *greater than or equal to*, or `is` and `is not`, which are similar to `==` and `!=`, but check for *identity* rather than *equality*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this practice, experiment with the code cell below. To get you started, here are some questions you could consider:\n",
    "* Does `'étrange'` equal `'etrange'`? How about `'Joe'` and `'joe'`?\n",
    "* Does `7. == 7` yield the same result as `7. is 7`? How about `!=` and `is not`?\n",
    "* Is `'27'` greater than or equal to `5`? (Note the quotation marks)\n",
    "* What happens if you try to execute `82 = 82`? Why does that happen?\n",

    "In order to do real programming in Python, you need to be able to define your own functions. To define a function, you need to use a `def` statement. This is the format:\n",

    "\n",
    "    return output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are developing code, it is a good practice to include comments explaining what it does, so that other people can understand your code—and so that you can understand it when you come back to it later. There are two ways of writing a comment in Python:\n",

    "\n",
    "With the knowledge you have of Python's basic structures, you are now ready for your first big assignment: to define your own **object class** and use it to create your own **instances**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on what we covered in the lecture, you are going to build a class for making shopping lists in Python. You will first define a ne **class** called `ShoppingList`. You will then use this **class** to create several different shopping lists for different shops you need to visit. Each of these particular shopping lists will be an **instance** of the `ShoppingList` **class**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be useful, the `ShoppingList` class needs to be able to do four things:\n",
    "* Store information about which shop you are going to (we will use an **attribute** to do this)\n",
    "* Store a list of items you need to buy inside it (we will use an **attribute** to do this)\n",
    "* Allow you to add new items to the list (we will use a **method** to do this)\n",
    "* Allow you to remove items from the list once you have bought them (we will use another **method** to do this)\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to see how the `ShoppingList` will be similar to `KungFuFighter`. `KungFuFighter` also stored some data (the `name`, `hit_points` and `strength` of the fighter) and had some useful methods (`.kick()` and `.get_kicked()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This Section is in two parts. First you need to define `ShoppingList` using a `class` statement. Then in the following section you need to create two **instances** of this class for two shops that you are going to visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 1.8: Define the `ShoppingList` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you need to define the class. I have already provided the `class` statement and docstring to get you going. To complete the assignment, you need to do three things:\n",
    "1. Write an `__init__` method that defines the class's attributes. The `ShoppingList` class needs two attributes: `self.shop`, the name of the shop that the list is for, and `self.items`, the items that the user wants to buy at the shop. `self.items` should be of the `set` type. **Remember:** Here you are defining the **class**, not a particular **instance** of a shopping list. Your `__init__` function will take information from the user and save it inside the object. I have provided some guidance in the code cell below.\n",
    "2. Write an `add_item` method that allows the user to add an item to their shopping list. If you correctly defined `self.items` as a `set` in step 1, then you will be able to make use of `self.items`'s built-in `.add()` method.\n",
    "3. Write a `buy_item` method that removes an item from the shopping list once the user has bought it. If you have correctly defined `self.items` as a `set` in step 1, then you will be able to make use of `self.items`'s `.remove()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "* I show how to complete this assignment in detail in Explainer Video 1 - 3, starting at about 10 minutes.\n",
    "* Make sure you keep track of your indentation. Each `def` statement (for `__init__`, `add_item` and `buy_item`) should be indented 4 spaces. Everything *inside* any of those `def` statements should be indented 4 spaces more\n",
    "* None of the functions you define inside `ShoppingList` need a `return` statement, as they are all object **methods** that manipulate the object itself rather than returning an output to the user"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've made it to the end of Week 1, and learned some serious programming skills along the way. You now know all the fundamental concepts of object-orientd programming in Python: variables, operators, functions, objects, classes, attributes and methods. You can create your own unique software by defining your own custom functions and--even cooler--by defining your own unique object classes that let you package together data and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Week 2 we will start to see how you can apply your new skills to literary analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extension 1.20\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to challenge yourself, you could try creating a new version of your `ShoppingList` object with improved functionality. You can do this easily using subclassing. I have provided the necessary code below. When you create a subclass, you create a new object which has all the same attribute and methods as its parent object by default. Then you can add a new method or two, or overwrite an existing method as you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things you could try:\n",
    "* Redefine the `__init__` method so that the user can add items to the shopping list when it is first initialised\n",
    "* Add a new method that displays which items are in the list, so that the user doesn't need to use the `print()` function\n",
    "* **Advanced:** Change the `.add_item` and `.buy_item` methods so that users can add or buy multiple items at once. There is a clever trick that will let you do this by simply adding a single character to the `items` parameter in the function definition, and then below when you use `.add()` or `.remove()`. The trick is called unpacking. You can [read about it here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html?highlight=unpacking#unpacking-argument-lists)."
