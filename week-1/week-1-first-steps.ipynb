    "### Practice 1.1: Assignment vs. Equality\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the explainer videos, there are two different kinds of equals sign in Python (as in many other programming languages). A single equals sign, `=`, is the *assignment operator*. It assigns a value to a variable. The double equals sign, `==`, is the *equality operator*. It checks if one variable or literal is equal to another. There are a range of similar operators in Python, such as `!=`, which is the *negation operator*, or `>=`, which is *greater than or equal to*, or `is` and `is not`, which are similar to `==` and `!=`, but check for *identity* rather than *equality*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this practice, experiment with the code cell below. To get you started, here are some questions you could consider:\n",
    "* Does `'étrange'` equal `'etrange'`? How about `'Joe'` and `'joe'`?\n",
    "* Does `7. == 7` yield the same result as `7. is 7`? How about `!=` and `is not`?\n",
    "* Is `'27'` greater than or equal to `5`? (Note the quotation marks)\n",
    "* What happens if you try to execute `82 = 82`? Why does that happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's different operators are explained in the [Expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html?highlight=operators#comparisons) chapter of the official documentation."

    "### Assignment 1.2: Define your own function\n",

    "\n",
    "    # At the end of a function, you should usually have a `return` statement, which says what the output of the function will be.\n",
    "    # If there is no 'return' statement, then the function will not have an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "    return output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are developing code, it is a good practice to include comments explaining what it does, so that other people can understand your code—and so that you can understand it when you come back to it later. There are two ways of writing a comment in Python:\n",

    "## Section 3: Types and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Every variable (or literal) in Python has both a **type** and a **value**. You have already encountered several types, including strings and integers. Here are some of Python's most common types:\n",
    "\n",
    "Type | Definition | Example Value\n",
    "--- | --- | ---\n",
    "`str` | A string of characters | 'Ramayana' or \"Ramayana\"\n",
    "`int` | A whole number | 891\n",
    "`float` | A decimal number (a [floating point number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic), in computer science terms) | 75.442\n",
    "`list` | An ordered collection of items | [9, 10, 10, 41]\n",
    "`tuple` | An immutable\\* ordered collection of items | (9, 10, 10, 41)\n",
    "`dict` | A labelled collection of items | {'author':'Eliza Haywood', 'title':'Betsy Thoughtless', 'year':1751}\n",
    "`set` | An unordered collection of unique items | {25,41,100028}\n",
    "\n",
    "\\* We will cover the distinction between 'mutable' and 'immutable' variables in **Week 3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is where things get a bit more complicated. Python is a so-called [object-oriented programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming). This means that (with a very few exceptions), nearly everything you encounter is Python is an **object** that combines *data* with *functionality*. We have already seen some free-floating functions like `print()` and `int()` and your own `concatenate()` function that you can use to do this or that using Python. But objects also have built-in functions, usually known as **methods**, which allow them to do things. When we talk about objects, we often refer to their **class** rather than their **type**, but the two words are synonymous.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important class of object you will need for your Haiku generator is the `list`. It has [many useful methods](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html). Execute the cell below to see some of them in action."

    "## Section 4: Building a Haiku Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "With the knowledge you have of Python's basic structures, you are now ready for your first big assignment: to build a Haiku generator. To do this, you are going to define a new class, `HaikuGenerator`. This class will contain data: a set of pre-written lines that can be used to construct haikus. It will also contain methods: methods for updating the database of haiku lines, and also for generating new haikus.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you hopefully know, a haiku is a traditional form of Japanese poetry that consists of three lines of 5, 7, and 5 syllables each. Traditionally a haiku should also have a *kigo*, or a reference to a season, and a *kireji* or 'cutting word', which flips or bifurcates the meaning of the poem. This is a programming assignment, however, so you will not be marked on whether your poems fit these strict requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, you will need to have some lines to upload into your HaikuGenerator...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 1.7: Create a list of `short_lines` and a list of `long_lines`\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first part of this assignment, you need to create a `list` of short lines (roughly five syllables each) and a list of long lines (roughly seven syllables each). You should have at least 6 short lines and 3 long lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw above, to create a list you use square brackets:\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list = [item1, item2, item3, ...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're struggling to think of lines, you could borrow a line or two from famous haikus by [Matsuo Basho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsuo_Bash%C5%8D), [Wendy Cope](https://poetryarchive.org/poem/strugnells-haiku/) or [Richard Wright](https://livinghaikuanthology.com/index-of-poets/livinglegacies/2711-richard-wright.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task:\n",
    "* Create a list called `short_lines` that contains at least six five-syllable lines (don't worry too much about the syllable count)\n",
    "* Create a list called `long_lines` that contains at least three seven-syllable lines (ditto on the syllable count)"

    "Congratulations! Having complete this Jupyter Notebook, you are an accomplished Python programmer already. All Python programs involve literals, variables, types (also called classes), functions, objects and methods. Now that you know how functions and objects are defined, you have a direct insight into the guts of Python. A 'package' is really just a big set of customised classes and functions that work together to provide a range of functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next week we will move into text analysis, building on the little taster you had this week with NLTK's `Text()` object. You will learn how to import your own text data into Python, and start analysing patterns in the words.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you enjoyed the first week of this course. See you next week for **Week 2: Text Analysis**."

    "If you try your haiku generator a few times, you will see that it sometimes makes a silly mistake: it uses the same line for the first line and the last line! Perhaps you find this repetition poetic, and don't mind. But if you would rather the generator used three *unique* lines in each poem, then you will need to change the `.generate_haiku()` method.\n",

    "I have started off your answer for you. Using [inheritance](https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/classes.html?highlight=expressions#inheritance), we can create a *new* class that inherits all of the attributes and methods of another class. All you need to do is write a new, better version of the `.generate_haiku()` method.\n",

    "**Hint:** You might like to import the `sample` function from the `random` package. [See the documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.sample). If you do import any functions from other packages, make sure you do so *outside* the definition of the class."
